### Computer
* A UNIX like operating system
 * **Linix**, or **OSX** are recommend
* A Pacakage Manager for your opperating System
* A plain text editor
 * Recomend one of these [atom](https://atom.io/), [vim](http://www.vim.org/), or [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
* A terminal app
* **BASH** setup as your default shell
 * some of the examples in this book will be specific to bash... zsh, fish, csh, ksh, and... work differnlty and will not work with the examples. If you want to switch shells when your done with this book feel free, but i doubt you will want to because you will know bash inside and out :)! We use bash, because it is usualy the default shell on unix opperating sytems. This makes it easy to trouble shoot because most of the documention on the internet on "how to use the command line" uses bash syntax and commands.
