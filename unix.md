# What is UNIX?

### TL;DR
Unix is an old operating system that we dont really use any more. **Linix** and **OSX** are basicaly unix. This book uses "Unix" to represent all the operating systems that are basicly unix. This book is not a Unix history book, and doesnt care to argue with the world about what makes an operating system Unix. This book is to help developers learn all the commands that will make them wicked good at the command line. So they can develope faster and have more fun! 
 
### unabridged
**UNIX** is a very confusing and often missused name. Unix is an operating system that was developed at [Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs) in the 1970's. Its design made it very adaptable to the ways computers have changed over the last 40 years. Unix implementations are extremly popular operating systems for modenr computers. There are a handful of free and propriatry unix implementations including **Linix**, **Darwin**(OS X), **Solaris**, and **FreeBSD**. Each Unix implementation is uniq, and has its own flavor to the way it works. Which means they are not identical, but they have enough in common that if you can do something on one, you can expect it to be done "the same way" on another. People often use `*nix` to represent all of the Unix implementations in a sinlge word. [learnyounix](README.md) is not geared towards any particular Unix implementaion. However, using **Linix**, or **OS X** to follow a long this book is recommend.

This book will not teach you the history of Unix, or how to use your operating system. It will teach you how and when to use a ton of different unix commands, so that you can shred at the command line :)!
