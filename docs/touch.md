# touch
> create an empty file

`$ touch <filename>`

Touch is most often used to create an empty file. However creating an empty file is not actually its purpose. The true purpose of the touch command is to modify the time stamp of the last time a file has been modified. However most often you will use it to create an empty file.

## examples
``` sh
# create an empty file named `index.html`

touch index.html
```
